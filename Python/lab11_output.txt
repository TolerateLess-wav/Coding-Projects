Python
is
a
great
object-oriented,
interpreted,
and
interactive
programming
language.
Python
combines
remarkable
power
with
very
clear
syntax.
It
has
modules,
classes,
exceptions,
very
high
level
dynamic
data
types,
and
dynamic
typing.
There
are
interfaces
to
many
system
calls
and
libraries,
as
well
as
to
various
windowing
systems.
New
built-in
modules
are
easily
written
in
C
or
C++
(or
other
languages,
depending
on
the
chosen
implementation).
Python
is
also
usable
as
an
extension
language
for
applications
written
in
other
languages
that
need
easy-to-use
scripting
or
automation
interfaces.
