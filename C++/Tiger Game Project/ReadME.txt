------------Tiger Card Game-------------
The aim of the game is to beat the computer!

Both you and the computer picks a hand from a shuffled deck, and draws a card for a specified amount of rounds.

The player with the most points wins that round, and the total wins the entire game!
Ex: You play a purple:5 and the computer plays a purple:9
The computer wins that round, and you play again until all rounds are completed.

Each card is numbered 1 to 10
Each card is either the color orange or purple:
Purple cards are regular cards
Orange cards are double the number the card is Ex: A card with orange:6 now has 12 points instead of 6

You pick and choose which card you want to play by picking the number option
Ex: [1] purple:2 [2] orange:3
Choose [1] on your keyboard to pick purple:2

Have fun and enjoy!
